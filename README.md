# Java-Advanced-ATM-Application
This project is an advanced version of the previous simple ATM application. It includes functions such as user login, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal. The application uses an Account class to manage user accounts and transactions, an ATM class to handle ATM operations, and a Login class for user authentication.
